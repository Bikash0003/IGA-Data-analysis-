# ♻️ Circular Economy Strategies to Reduce Food Waste in IGA Supermarkets

## 📌 Overview
This project applies circular economy (CE) principles—reuse, redistribution, and recovery—to reduce food waste in IGA supermarkets. Using real sales data from IGA Valley, we analyzed department-level trends and benchmarked them against Woolworths and Coles to develop data-driven sustainability strategies.

## 📊 Data Sources
- IGA Valley 1-month department sales data
- Annualized IGA performance (extrapolated)
- Sustainability data from Coles, Woolworths, and other Australian supermarkets (2024)

## 📈 Key Analyses
- Descriptive statistics for sales, profit, discounts
- T-tests: Perishable vs. Non-perishable performance
- Visual comparisons: waste diversion, revenue, emissions
- Annual projections from monthly data
- Benchmarking against national competitors

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- Excel (for raw data processing)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Key Insights
- IGA Valley diverts only ~65.9% of its waste vs. 80–82.5% by competitors
- High markdown in perishables may lead to avoidable waste
- Sales and profit concentration in few departments can mask inefficiencies
- Circular economy strategies can improve both profit and sustainability

## 💡 Recommendations
- Expand donation and redistribution efforts
- Improve tracking of perishable stock and markdown impact
- Educate staff on food handling and CE principles
- Scale successful strategies across other IGA stores
